### Start

- For dev

```
$ yarn run start
```
This will start a Node.js server with Webpack Middleware

- Build

```
$ yarn run build
```
This will bundle everything in the /dist/ directory

### Docs
- [blueprint](https://github.com/yuqingc/freljord/blob/master/docs/blueprint.md) is a brief plan of the entire project
- [devlog](https://github.com/yuqingc/freljord/blob/master/docs/devlog) records developing progress
- [shit](https://github.com/yuqingc/freljord/blob/master/docs/shit.md) might offers you some advice which helps avoid annoying things while developing
- [todos](https://github.com/yuqingc/freljord/blob/master/docs/todos) 

### Code style conventions

Code style is checked by tslint with `tslint.json`. Here are some conventions about TypeScript importing conventions that tslint does not cover.

Any developers of this project should follow these rules:

- Importing statement blocks of internal and external modules (in `node_modules/`) should be seperated with an empty line 
- You don't have to order your importings by alphabet
- Importing statements of external modules must go before any internal modules
- Absolute path relative to the baseUrl, defined by `tsconfig.json`,  is recommended
- Don't use too deep relative parent path, eg., `../../something`, `../something`, which makes it hard to understand the code

Here is an example 

- Good

```js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import sidebarRouterConfig, { ISidebarRouter } from 'utils/sidebarRouterConfig';
import Container from './Container';
import { Home } from 'components/home';
import NotFound from './NotFound';
```

- Don't do this

```js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Home } from 'components/home'; // need an empty line 
import sidebarRouterConfig, { ISidebarRouter } from '../../utils/sidebarRouterConfig'; // too many `../`
import Container from './Container';
import NotFound from './NotFound';
import React from 'react'; // external module importing should go to the beginning
```
